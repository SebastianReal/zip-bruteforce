# Zip Bruteforce Cracker

This project attempts to brute-force the password of a protected `.zip` file using a wordlist in a `.txt`.

## How It Works

The script iterates through each password in a given wordlist and attempts to extract the contents of the zip file. When the correct password is found, it is printed to the console.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository  
2. Place your `.zip` and `.txt` files in the root directory  
3. Run the script
